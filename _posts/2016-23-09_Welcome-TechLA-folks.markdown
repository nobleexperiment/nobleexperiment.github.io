The Pleasure and The Privilege is mine to meet everyone of you.

I'm a struggling freelance developer and actor armed with nearly 20 years of self-taught experience in web development, mobile and cloud application development and operations, network and operations security with creative flair in design and acting. I'm also a freelance writer engaging in conversational topics and interests.

If you're wondering where the origin of nobleexperiment came from, I took it as a baseball geek from the headline of a Brooklyn Newspaper introducing Jackie Robinson's debut as a Brooklyn Dodger: "Branch Rickey's Noble Experiment." That also became my github and twitter handle name.

I am Available.

Cheers,
Al Porotesano
