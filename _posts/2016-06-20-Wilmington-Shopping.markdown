Every Thursday of the week, A block of L Street at the intersection of Avalon and L Street is closed for the [Wilmington Farmers Market](http://www.yelp.com/biz/wilmington-farmers-market-wilmington). On Sundays, [The Wilmington Swap Meet](http://www.yelp.com/biz/los-angeles-harbor-college-swap-meet-wilmington) is held weekly at the Los Angeles Harbor Community College parking lots. They're both good deals for an unemployed penny pincing survivor like myself and the closest to good organic foods without going to some yuppie establishment like Whole Foods or Bristol Farms.

## The Wilmington Farmers Market

I like the Wilmington Farmers Market. I can get four nicely-firmed and ripe avocados for $5 while nibbling on free samples of variations of Oranges and Grapefruits. Food booths can be a bit inconsistent. The Papusas and tamales booth is a mainstay of the market, but the bbq booth or the hawaiian food booth is sometimes there. It's not that crowded except at the start of Lunch time for most workers between 11am to 1pm.

## The Wilmington Swap Meet

[Anthony Bourdain wanted to create some Cyberpunk Farmer's Market](http://consequenceofsound.net/2015/05/anthony-bourdain-to-open-giant-blade-runner-themed-food-market-in-new-york-city/) in the alleyways of New York City based on the underground economy of the movie Blade Runner. I find that comparable theme a bit fitting to describe the atmosphere of the Wilmington Swap Meet. It's a convergence of chaos, economics, and fantasy. You can buy anything here, but you'll need to be cautious as details matter. I find having streetsmarts of the market as a competitive advantage if you can haggle the price for 40 pounds of legos for more than $50.

The Wilmington Swap Meet opens every Sunday (except Holidays on a Sunday, like Easter or Christmas). Admission is Free. Parking is free by the football field (I remember it as Lot L back in the day), but it's completely full and competitive for open spots. There's paid parking at the parking structure and at the park across L street.

**Caveat Emptor**

At the Swap Meet, be prepared to find some vendors selling expired food. There's a booth selling 3 candy bars for one dollar. That's too good to be true because it's typically that. The candy bars are past it's expiration date by up to two years. I bought a snickers bar and the chocolate looked like it was blooming. It's a bit odd considering it didn't melt in the 80 degree heat last week. I usually go to that said booth to buy grounded coffee for a buck or two. At least they don't stale as fast as their candy bars.

Speaking spanish is an another advantage here. I don't look look mexican and if I open my mouth, my spanish is without an identifiable accent, therefore my repertoire can get me to buy 3 large haas avocados at $5 but not lower than that. I'm pretty thankful for two years of spanish with watching some telenovelas and being raised in Carson to get by.

Whatever they sell that gives you the impression that the item they're selling may be stolen is a crapshoot. I see some booths selling road bikes at a good price, but if I buy the bike, I'd rather not think the vendor is selling me a stolen one. If it's a carbon-frame road bike, that's likely going to raise suspicions to an above-average minded shopper.

**That's a Steal!**

Here at the LAHCC wilmington swap meet, I've managed to find a booth selling trash bags of legos weighing at 40 pounds sold for $50 to $80 a bag. "What's the big deal about that?" you say. You can sell them at bricklink.com and those bags of legos seem like a very profitable enterprise just for selling lego parts.

Automobile parts, medical equipment, and electronics are almost half the price less than the stores they're sold at. I found the price of a walker for $50, lawnmower gears at $5, automobile headlamps for old cars at $10, and SATA hard drives at $10. Sure, I could get them on amazon or ebay's network of buyers, but at the wilmington swap meet, I know what i'm buying is price negotiable.

**That'll leave a sour taste in my mouth**

There's this food booth at the corner of one market lot selling quesadlillas, tortas, and bacon-wrapped hot dogs. I wouldn't eat the quesadillas with Al Pastor. They make decent bacon-wrapped dogs, but the quesadillas with Al Pastor was terribly greasy. I ate more grease than the cheese there. If the grease concerns you, there's a food truck that makes decent quesadillas next to the booth.

Parts of wilmington house registered sex offenders. I saw one guy rubbing up on a mannequin with laced panties like he wanted to toss that salad. That's gross. To do that in front of kids with families at broad daylight though, that's an act that should have him under house arrest.

**That's Odd, I didn't know they sold that!**

There was a booth selling surveillance and spying kits next to a booth selling DirecTV and Dish subscriptions. I thought that was odd, but it attracted a lot of people. I come in to check it out and they were just selling mini-cameras disguised as teddy bears. I was looking for a microphone boom that can detect sound a mile away, but they didn't have that.

I found a booth selling Cakes. They were taking orders for all kinds of occasions. Wedding Cakes and Quincenera cakes look like they're the big sellers here.

There was this booth selling sham-wow and car scratch paint covers... complete with a guy giving a demonstration over a shiny Toyota Supra. The way he sold his product was like Billy Mays without the screaming and the persuasion of the Most Interesting Dos Equis guy in the world. It's a sideshow worthy of 3 minutes of your time.

You can buy Furniture there. The booth next to it, you can buy a foreclosed house listing homes in Wilmington, San Pedro, and Harbor City. It's fitting those two booths can compliment each other.

## Shopping here is a chance of a lifetime

I prefer the Wilmington Farmer's Market on a Thursday over the Carson Farmer's Market. What wilmington lacks in Food booths completely makes up for it in Fruits and Vegetables. It's conversely true for the Carson Farmer's Market where they make up for that in Food booths. When the Carson Farmer's Market moved to California State University, Dominguez Hills from the South Bay Pavillion (It's Carson Mall to me), the number of grocer booths diminished to make room for food booths. Plus there's one or two food trucks at the Wilmington Market to enjoy a $5 lunch.

Travel westbound on L Street toward the LA Harbor Community College on a sunday is the Wilmington swap meet. Just go there. It's a new experience you'll never find in gentrified neighborhoods of Los Angeles, and it's a reminiscience of the old secret economies us old schoolers of Wilmington, Harbor City, and Carson still hold on to that made this town great.
