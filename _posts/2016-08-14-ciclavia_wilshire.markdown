CicLAvia is a block party, parade, and a carnival connecting neighborhoods as bicycle hubs connecting as a celebrational network on a closed street. Which in this case, Wilshire blvd was shut down for our CicLAvia parade.

I volunteer at CicLAvia as a Route Angel. Armed with my bike tools with cicLAvia's tire tubes and patches, I'm a mobile bike mechanic repairing bikes. Route Angels are decorated in yellow shirts with bike pumps and alien II swiss-army-knife of bike tools ensuring everyone's safety and fixing bikes all day. We volunteer our time and energy with the CicLAvia staff to promote bicycle advocacy on the streets of Los Angeles.

Today was my unusual day of duty because I ditched my bike at CicLAvia for Pokemon Hunting. I had some eggs to hatch in my incubator and some pokeballs to grab while I'm walking on the job.

## Churches are the unsung heroes of CicLAvia ##

I am always greatful for the churches and their youth groups on the routes. At the front of the [Immannuel Presbyterian Church of Wilshire](http://immanuelpres.org/en_US/), They gave free water bottles to keep cyclists hydrated at CicLAvia under the hot August Sun.
