CicLAvia is a block party, parade, and a carnival connecting neighborhoods as bicycle hubs connecting as a celebrational network on a closed street. Which in this case, Wilshire blvd was shut down for our CicLAvia parade.

I volunteer my sundays as a Route Angel. Armed with my tools and cicLAvia's bike tubes and patches, I'm a mobile bike mechanic repairing bikes. Route Angels want to make sure you're having a good time at CicLAvia. We volunteer our time and energy with the CicLAvia staff on the day of CicLAvia for that reason to passionately promote bicycle advocacy in the streets of Los Angeles.

Today was my unusual day of duty because I ditched my bike at CicLAvia for Pokemon Hunting. I had some eggs to hatch in my incubator and some pokeballs to grab while I'm walking on the job.

*** Churches are the unsung heroes of CicLAvia ***

In my 5 years of volunteering at CicLAvia, I'm always greatful for the church members on the routes. They give out free water bottles to replenish cyclists at CicLAvia when the church is on their route.
