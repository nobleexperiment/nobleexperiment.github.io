*This is an introductory page for one of my jekyll or wordpress powered pages I'll be blogging about the city of Wilmington, California. I'm going to do some soft launch pages on my technical posts until I can get a good lift of my site (and maybe portal) through the duration of the summer.

Welcome to Wilmington, California. Neighboring visitors like myself used to avoid Wilmington since its inception of violence and pollution  gripped the Los Angeles neighborhood at the latter three decades of the 20th Century. Wilmington was rich with a glorious past as the harbor gateway to the Pacific that transformed into an ugly and violent industrial hinterland. 

I occasionally stayed at my relatives' house at the Hawaiian Avenue Housing Projects by the waterfront. I think it was 1985 or 86 when I was a kid. That part of wilmington was a honeypot of violence. The Waterfront Crips defended their turf against a bunch of surrounding gangs in the South Bay. When Scottsdale and Tortilla Flats from neighboring Carson came over, somebody would be dead on arrival. At the projects there was this comfortable lie of gunshots as lit firecrackers. They did what they could to hide the violent apparition surrounding them, but being 6 years old in Wilmington on a summer afternoon it would be believeable if I didn't see a cholo holding a gun busting caps outside the window. It's all they can do to render a smokescreen of happiness with nightly prayers to God for protection; that somehow worked.

For two decades, Wilmington was avoided from its surrounding neighbors to visit for a good reason. It was one of the most violent neighborhoods of Los Angeles rivaling that of Highland Park, Echo Park, Boyle Heights, Leimert Park, and South Central LA. That's just the listing of comprables in (https://data.lacity.org/A-Safe-City/Los-Angeles-Homicide-Heat-Map-2014/uahr-pi5p)[Los Angeles' proper borders] without including the City of Compton and Lynwood. 1992 was the (http://articles.latimes.com/1993-01-05/local/me-819_1_los-angeles-county)[apex of LA Homicides] approaching close to 2,600 killings in the year of the LA riots. Bundle the anarchic environment of Los Angeles with a crippling recession and a slew of earthquakes, those with the money left the city and the poor was left behind to endure the garbagescape.

I came back to see how Wilmington is doing now. It's a bit clean, but the familliar stores and street corners are still the same. My relatives left Wilmington for better pastures. The only noticeable change is the Hawaiian Avenue Projects was torn down and re-built with a cluster of nice town homes and condominiums for low-income families next to the newly built waterfront park. Wilmington doesn't look like a total shithole it once was, but surrounded by the ports of Los Angeles and Oil Refineries from Carson, the air is still stifiling on hot and humid days.

I'm dedicating this website to write about my experiences in this town. There's things to explore here given my perspective of the town from it's northern neighbor from the city of Carson. It's been almost 20 years since I went to a Banning High football game since they played against their hated rival and my alma-mater of the north, Carson High Colts. Two decades flew by, a lot has changed in my life. The city of Carson is transforming into a "destination city", really it's just being gentrified as I write. With exception of the Waterfront Park and the re-built Hawaiian Avenue Projects, Wilmington hasn't changed.

This is my twice weekly stories about the working-class city untouched by a wave of Gentrification sweeping the Los Angeles cityscape.
